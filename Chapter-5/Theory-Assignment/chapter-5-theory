# What is the difference between Named export, Default Export and * Export?
ANS : 
Named Export when you export your React “function components” with its names. 
eg export const Title = (props) => { }; and when you export like this 
   import {Title} from './component/Title'  you have to import like this 

Default export
const Title = (props) => { }; //React “function components” call without its names
export default Title; //Call by defult you can call defaylt only one Conponrnt
 import Title from './component/Title' you have to import like this in case of default

* as export...
i guess this should be import... 
* as import (will call all your export named react component)
eg
export const Title = (props) => { };  // react “function components” 
export const Search = (props) => { }; //  react “function components”
import * as Obj from  './component/Title' you have to import like

# What is the importance of Config.js file?
ANS:
Will configure your static variable at the same file so you won't keep searching the var which you need to use so many places in component.

# What are React Hooks?
ANS:
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects. With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components.

# Why do we need useState Hook?
ANS:
The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!
