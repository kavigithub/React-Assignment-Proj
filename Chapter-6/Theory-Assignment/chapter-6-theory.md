## 1. What is a Microservice?
ans:
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.

Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.

## 2. What is Monolith architecture?
Monolith Architecture is the traditional model of software development where the application is self-contained and independent of other applications. It is also called Single Tier (One tier) architecture where a single application acts as both client and server. A small change in a single function requires compiling and testing the entire application, which is against the today's agile approach.

## 3. Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
With monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled. Adding or improving a monolithic applicationâ€™s features becomes more complex as the code base grows. This complexity limits experimentation and makes it difficult to implement new ideas. Monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because many dependent and tightly coupled processes increase the impact of a single process failure.

With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs. Services are built for business capabilities and each service performs a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.
